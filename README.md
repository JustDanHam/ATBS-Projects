# ATBS-Projects
My solutions to the practice projects in Al Sweigart's book: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).

_This was my introduction to Python, and each project was created using the knowledge gained at that point in the book. There is almost certainly better/ more optimal solutions._

_All uploaded projects were working at time of upload._
